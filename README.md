<h1>A Children Game for 3DS</h1>

In this project I will make a game for 3DS where the child will tap the bottom screen to hear the sound of animal.
This project is for study purpose.

<h2>How to compile</h2>

To compile this code you will need [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to convert the content in gfx folder into a image where 3DS can use into .3dsx file.

- Install [DevKitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases) 
- Make a simple "make" in the folder where the make file is in
```
make
```

<h2>How to use the game on your 3DS</h2>
